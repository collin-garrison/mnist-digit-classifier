# MNIST Digit Classifier

A convolutional neural network built with PyTorch to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.

### Workflow
- Data preprocessing (normalization and augmentation)
- Model design and training
- Loss and accuracy visualizations to monitor overfitting
- Confusion matrix to analyze misclassifications

### Results
- Achieved 99.5% accuracy on the test set

### Tools Used
- Python
- PyTorch
- Jupyter Notebook
- matplotlib
